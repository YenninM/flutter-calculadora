mi_calculadora

This project is a simple calculator built with Flutter, allowing users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The app was created as part of an exercise to learn and practice mobile app development with Flutter.

Description
The app was developed using Flutter, a mobile development framework created by Google, which allows you to build native applications for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. Android Studio was used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for building and running the project.

The app was simulated and tested using the Pixel 9 Pro API 35 emulator to ensure compatibility and smooth functionality on Android devices.

This project features a simple and modern user interface, designed to be easy to use, with buttons for each number and mathematical operation. It's a basic yet effective tool, perfect for users who need to make quick calculations.
